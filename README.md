# Movie Recommender System with LSTM

## Abstract
People watch movies as a recreation in their spare time. However, it is difficult to
select movies that suit our tastes, especially with a massive amount of movies made
available by various movie platforms. In our project, we aim to establish a movie
recommender system that make personalized movie recommendations to the users,
by analyzing the movies that the users have previously watched in the past. We
use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to train, refine and experiment our model
on Movielens dataset. The experiment results indicate high performance in terms of
accuracy of predictions and generate reliable personalized movie recommendations.
